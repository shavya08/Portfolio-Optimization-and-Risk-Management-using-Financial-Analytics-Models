# Portfolio-Optimization-and-Risk-Management-using-Financial-Analytics-Models

# Project Overview
This project explores various portfolio optimization models using historical data from 17 industry portfolios (sourced from Ken Frenchâ€™s data library) to help balance the trade-off between risk and return. The focus is on three main strategies:

# Mean-Variance Optimization: A strategy that aims to maximize return for a given level of risk.
Minimum Variance Optimization: A strategy that focuses on minimizing portfolio risk without targeting a specific return.
Naive Portfolio Strategy: An equally weighted portfolio that serves as a benchmark for comparison.
The models were evaluated across three estimation windows (12, 36, and 72 months) to assess how different time periods affect portfolio performance.

# Objectives
Develop and implement portfolio optimization models.
Analyze performance across different time horizons to assess the risk-return trade-off.
Compare model results to identify optimal strategies for various investor risk appetites.

# Methodology
The project was developed using Python, leveraging libraries such as:

pandas for data manipulation,
numpy for numerical operations,
matplotlib for data visualization,
scipy for optimization techniques.

# Data Preprocessing
Historical return data was cleaned and normalized to ensure accurate model inputs.
The dataset spans from 1926 to 2024, providing extensive historical data for robust analysis.

# Model Implementation
Mean-Variance Optimization: This model calculates the portfolio that maximizes return for a given level of risk by using mean return and covariance matrices.

Achieved a mean return of 1.04% with a standard deviation of 4.86% using a 36-month window.
Minimum Variance Optimization: This model minimizes risk without regard to return.

The 72-month window yielded the lowest risk with a standard deviation of 3.62%, making it suitable for risk-averse investors.
Naive Portfolio Strategy: This equally weighted approach provided a mean return of 1.13% with a higher standard deviation of 5.31%, reflecting its higher risk and volatility.

# Comparative Analysis
The models were compared across different time windows (12, 36, and 72 months):

12-month window: More responsive to recent market changes but with increased volatility.
36-month window: Balanced risk and return, making it suitable for moderate-risk investors.
72-month window: Smoothed out short-term market fluctuations, resulting in more stable returns.

# Results
The Mean-Variance model (36-month window) provided the highest risk-adjusted return.
The Minimum Variance model (72-month window) minimized risk, ideal for conservative investors.
The Naive Portfolio strategy, while providing the highest return, carried the most risk and volatility.

# Visualizations
Key insights from the models were visualized using scatter plots to compare the risk-return profiles of each strategy. These visualizations highlighted the performance of each model, providing clear insights into the trade-offs between risk and return.

# Key Takeaways
Mean-Variance Optimization is ideal for investors looking for a balance between return and risk.
Minimum Variance Optimization is best suited for investors prioritizing risk minimization.
Naive Portfolio offers higher returns but with significantly increased volatility.
